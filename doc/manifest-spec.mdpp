Manifest Specification
======================

The current revision of this specification is: version 1.

This document covers the standardized format to be used for Combine manifest files, and how those files
should be interpreted by compliant applications.

!TOC

Definitions
===========

Data Types
----------

* String: A value represented by a series of characters or digits.

* List: An ordered series of arbitrary values that may or may not be sorted.

* Dictionary: A mapping of keys to values, where the keys can be a set of numbers or strings that define
  a one-to-one relationship with values of an arbitrary type.


File Classes and Formats
------------------------

There are three primary file classes that the Combine manifest format supports:

### Whole Files

This file class is considered to represent a single file or asset, in either a compressed
or uncompressed state.  Supported whole file formats include:

* "raw": Uncompressed file format, with no transformations applied.

* "gzip": Compressed file format as defined by [GNU gzip](http://www.gzip.org/).

* "bzip2": Compressed file format as defined by [bzip2](http://www.bzip.org/).

### Patch Files

This file class is considered to represent the changes between two revisions of a single
file, generally in a compressed state.  This class generally expects an existing (old) revision of a file
to exist as a target for a special application to apply the patch, resulting in the new revision of the
file.  Supported patch file formats include:

* "bsdiff": Compressed file patch format, as defined by [bsdiff](http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/)

### Package Files

This file class is considered to represent multiple files of the above file classes,
used for transmitting entire file hierarchies as single compressed package.  Supported package formats
include:

* "tar-gzip": Archive format, as defined by [GNU Tar](http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/), compressed
  using the gzip format defined by [GNU gzip](http://www.gzip.org/).

* "tar-bzip2": Archive format, as defined by [GNU Tar](http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/), compressed
  using the bzip2 format defined by [bzip2](http://www.bzip.org/).

* "zip": Compressed archive format, as defined by the
  [ZIP format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format))


URI Protocols
-------------

These are the URI protocols that must be supported for base manifest specification.  Other
protocols may be supported, but are not required:

* "http", "https": Remote location using the HTTP protocol.  Support for SSL connections and
  HTTP BASIC authentication is required.  Authentication credentials should be supplied as part
  of the URI string.

* "package": Local filesystem path, relative to the root path of an extracted package archive.
  As an example, if a package has been extracted to `/tmp/pack`, `package://path/to/file` would refer
  to a full file path of `/tmp/pack/path/to/file`.


Manifest Structure
==================

The manifest is represented as a dictionary containing values, lists or dictionaries to create
a hierarchy of data about what has changed in a file tree.


Manifest Properties
-------------------

* "current-version" (string)
  The version of the software already installed to the user's system.  In the case where the
  software has not yet been installed, this should be an empty string for convention.

* "update-version" (string)
  The version of the software that the user's installation will be updated to, or installed.

* "package-uri" (string)
  A URI pointing to a package file that contains files relevant to the upgrade.  This can either
  be a remote URI that the updater will need to fetch the package from, or it can be a local
  URI for cases where the package would be pre-distributed with the updater/installer.

* "package-format" (string, optional)
  In cases where the package file does not have a recognized file extension, this allows the
  updater to determine what format to use when extracting package contents.

* "package-sha1" (string)
  Hash fingerprint of the package file, using the SHA1 hashing algorithm, used to verify integrity
  of the package file before extracting contents.

* "actions" (list)
  A list of dictionaries, each containing a set of values regarding to an action to take for an
  individual file in the software installation.


Action Properties
-----------------

* "action" (string)
  Name of action to be performed.  Information about individual action types can be found
  in a later section of the specification.

* "filename" (string)
  Relative path and name of file, from the root of the software installation.

* "sha1-before" (string, contextual)
  Hash fingerprint of the installed file, using the SHA1 hashing algorithm, used to verify
  integrity of the file before performing the requested action.

* "sha1-after" (string, contextual)
  Hash fingerprint of the installed file, using the SHA1 hashing algorithm, used to verify
  integrity of the file after performing the requested action.

* "patch-uri" (string, contextual)
  A URI pointing to a patch file to be applied to an installed file.  This can either
  be a remote URI that the updater will need to fetch the file from, or it can be a local
  URI for cases where the package would be pre-distributed with the updater/installer.

* "patch-format" (string, contextual)
  In cases where the patch file does not have a recognized file extension, this allows the
  updater to determine what format to use when applying the patch contents.

* "full-uri" (string, contextual)
  A URI pointing to a full file to be applied to an installed file.  This can either
  be a remote URI that the updater will need to fetch the file from, or it can be a local
  URI for cases where the package would be pre-distributed with the updater/installer.

* "full-format" (string, contextual)
  In cases where the full file does not have a recognized file extension, this allows the
  updater to determine what format to use when decompressing the file contents.
